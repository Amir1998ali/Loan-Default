# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict loan default risk. It analyzes various features of loan applicants to assess their likelihood of defaulting on a loan.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- Deployment-ready pipeline

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to process data, train models, and evaluate performance:
```bash
jupyter notebook LoanDefault.ipynb
```

## Project Structure
- `LoanDefault.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all steps
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable)
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies

## Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of **XX%**, evaluated on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made by optimizing feature selection and trying different machine learning algorithms.

## License
This project is open-source and available for further development.
